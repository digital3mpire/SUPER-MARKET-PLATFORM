		      	<h3>NARRATIVE</h3>

					<p>The superinformation high market is the market in its maximum and final stage.
					It is an economy in total and constant flux that has merged with life into a new form of
					reality based on an intense information stream powered by the endless sources of energy
					drilled from deep within the earthâ€™s core. In the superinfromation high market everything is connected,
					because everything is one. It is the last product of a globalized hypercapitalistic technomachine and
					the result of the final massive bailout which was necessary when the last remaining supercompany collapsed.</p>

					<p>In the upcoming age of the super information high market virtual, augmented reality and meta physical
					reality will be merged into a higher surrogate of consciousness. Stimulated by the last forces of capital,
					boosted by internet technology in combination with the deep understanding and usage of morphogenetic fields,
					the world was transformed into a surreal state of permanent dreamtime, where being continously oscillates
					between TRUE and FALSE. This form of beeing is deeply stablizing and reassuring yet also highly arrousing
					and stimulating at the same time.</p>

					<p>Materiliazition ended when the flux of the information super high market started streaming,
					the mindset of mankind changed and with this step in evolution the world transformed into pure information.
					In these new situations the mode of production and accumulation disappeared. These processes where
					replaced by the concept of commiting and spreading. Market set, industrially fabricated serialized
					products lost there values and have been replaced by undefined lossfree reproducible entities
					which are created and designed by art driven people. The created entities are commited into the global
					git-based super structure, in the next step selected and surveyd via webinterfaces and then in a final step shared,
					spread and distributed into the social networks and hypermedia by the people to the people.</p>
